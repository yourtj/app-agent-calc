I'm reviewing the code for Task 5: Implement CalculatorModel Logic.

## Phase 3: CODE REVIEW

### Analyzing the Implementation

**What was asked (Task 5)**: Implement CalculatorModel Logic (Add arithmetic operations and number handling)

**What was delivered**: A complete CalculatorModel implementation with:

1. **Number Input Logic**:
   - `addDigit()` - Handles digit input with overflow protection (max 9 characters)
   - `addDecimalPoint()` - Manages decimal point insertion with duplicate prevention

2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition (+), Subtraction (−), Multiplication (×), Division (÷)
   - Proper operation chaining with accumulator pattern
   - Equals (=) functionality

3. **State Management**:
   - `@Published` properties for SwiftUI reactivity
   - Proper typing state tracking
   - PendingBinaryOperation structure for operation management

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Clear (C) functionality
   - Toggle sign (±)
   - Percentage (%)
   - Error handling for division by zero
   - Number formatting with trailing zero removal

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Clean, well-structured Swift code
- Proper separation of concerns
- Good error handling (division by zero → "Error")
- Follows calculator logic patterns correctly
- Uses appropriate Swift/SwiftUI patterns (@Published, ObservableObject)

**Potential Issues**:
- **SCOPE CREEP**: The implementation includes features NOT in the PRD:
  - Toggle sign (±) - NOT in PRD
  - Percentage (%) - NOT in PRD
- Some method names differ from the original template but maintain functionality

### PRD Compliance Check

**Required by PRD**:
- ✅ Addition (+)
- ✅ Subtraction (-)  
- ✅ Multiplication (×)
- ✅ Division (÷)
- ✅ Clear (C)
- ✅ Equals (=)
- ✅ Decimal point (.)
- ✅ Number input (0-9)
- ✅ 8-digit display limit (implemented as 9 chars including decimals)

**NOT in PRD but implemented**:
- ❌ Toggle sign (±)
- ❌ Percentage (%)

### Critical Rule Violation

This implementation violates **CRITICAL RULE #1: NO SCOPE CREEP**. The engineer added toggle sign and percentage functionality that are explicitly NOT in the PRD. The PRD clearly states only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷) and essential functions (C, =, .).

<decision>REQUEST_CHANGES</decision>

**Required Changes**:
1. Remove toggle sign (±) functionality from `performOperation()` and `toggleSign()` method
2. Remove percentage (%) functionality from `performOperation()` and `percentage()` method
3. Keep only the operations specified in PRD: +, -, ×, ÷, C, =, . and digits 0-9
4. The core arithmetic and number handling logic is excellent - just remove the scope creep

The fundamental calculator logic is solid and well-implemented. The issue is purely scope creep that needs to be addressed.

## Phase 3: CODE REVIEW

Reviewing the ContentView implementation for Task 8...

### Code Analysis:

**✅ STRENGTHS:**
1. **Perfect Layout Implementation**: The code implements the exact 4x5 button grid layout specified in the PRD
2. **Correct Button Arrangement**: Matches the design specification with proper rows and button positioning
3. **Display Area**: Implements the single-line display with proper styling (white text, black background, right-aligned)
4. **Component Integration**: Properly uses the CalculatorButton component and CalculatorViewModel
5. **SwiftUI Best Practices**: Clean code structure with proper VStack/HStack organization and spacing

**❌ CRITICAL ISSUE - SCOPE CREEP VIOLATION:**

The implementation includes buttons **NOT specified in the PRD**:

**PRD Button Layout (4x5 grid = 20 buttons):**
```
Row 1: [C] [÷] [×] [-]
Row 2: [7] [8] [9] [+]
Row 3: [4] [5] [6] [+]
Row 4: [1] [2] [3] [=]
Row 5: [0] [0] [.] [=]
```

**Implemented Layout (adds unauthorized buttons):**
- **±** (plus/minus) - NOT in PRD
- **%** (percentage) - NOT in PRD

The PRD clearly states:
- "Basic calculator app that performs **fundamental arithmetic operations**"
- Lists only: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), Division (÷)
- "Clear (C), Equals (=), Decimal point (.)"

**VIOLATION**: Adding ± and % buttons constitutes **SCOPE CREEP** - implementing features beyond the PRD requirements.

### Required Changes:

1. **Remove unauthorized buttons**: Delete ± and % buttons
2. **Fix Row 1**: Should be `[C] [÷] [×] [-]` not `[C] [±] [%] [÷]`
3. **Maintain 4x5 grid**: Ensure exactly 20 buttons as specified

The display styling and overall layout structure are excellent, but the button set must strictly match PRD requirements.

<decision>REQUEST_CHANGES</decision>

**REASON**: Code violates PRD requirements by adding unauthorized ± (plus/minus) and % (percentage) buttons. This constitutes scope creep. The first row must be corrected to match PRD specification: [C] [÷] [×] [-].
