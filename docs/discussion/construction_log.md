## PHASE 3: CODE REVIEW

I'm reviewing the Swift code for Task 1: Create Project Scaffolding.

### Code Analysis

**Files Created:**
1. `project.yml` - Xcode project configuration ✅
2. `Sources/App.swift` - Main app entry point ✅
3. `Sources/ContentView.swift` - Basic UI stub ✅
4. `Sources/Info.plist` - App configuration ✅

**Code Quality Assessment:**

**project.yml:**
- ✅ Correct iOS deployment target (15.0)
- ✅ Portrait-only orientation as required by PRD
- ✅ Proper bundle configuration
- ✅ Standard iOS app requirements

**App.swift:**
- ✅ Clean SwiftUI app entry point
- ✅ Follows SwiftUI best practices
- ✅ Minimal and appropriate for scaffolding

**ContentView.swift:**
- ✅ Basic placeholder view with preview
- ✅ Appropriate stub content
- ✅ Ready for future implementation

**Info.plist:**
- ✅ Portrait orientation lock matches PRD requirement
- ✅ Proper app metadata
- ✅ Standard iOS configuration

### Requirements Verification

**PRD Compliance:**
- ✅ Portrait orientation only (specified in Info.plist)
- ✅ iOS app structure established
- ✅ No scope creep - contains only basic scaffolding

**Design Compliance:**
- ✅ SwiftUI architecture foundation
- ✅ ContentView structure ready for MVVM implementation
- ✅ Project structure supports planned components

**Task Compliance:**
- ✅ All required files created
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Minimal compilable code as intended for scaffolding

### Technical Assessment

**Code Quality:**
- Clean, minimal code appropriate for scaffolding phase
- Follows Swift/SwiftUI conventions
- Proper file organization
- Build verification confirms compilation success

**Architecture Foundation:**
- SwiftUI app structure properly established
- Ready for MVVM implementation in later tasks
- No premature implementation - appropriate stub level

<decision>APPROVE</decision>

**Approval Reasoning:**
- All required scaffolding files created correctly
- Code builds successfully (system confirmed)
- Meets PRD requirements for iOS app with portrait orientation
- Appropriate minimal implementation for Task 1
- No scope creep - contains only what's needed for basic project structure
- Ready for subsequent implementation tasks
