## Execution Plan

1. Files to Create: 
   - `project.yml` (Xcode project configuration)
   - `App.swift` (Main app entry point)
   - `ContentView.swift` (Main UI container)
   - `CalculatorModel.swift` (Business logic and arithmetic operations)
   - `CalculatorViewModel.swift` (State management and user interaction logic)
   - `CalculatorButton.swift` (Reusable button component)
   - `Info.plist` (App configuration)

2. Template Strategy: 
   - First create project scaffolding with basic app structure
   - Then create empty template/stub files for each component with minimal compilable code
   - Finally implement features by adding logic to existing template files one by one

## Task List

- [x] Task 1: Create Project Scaffolding (project.yml, App.swift, ContentView.swift stubs, Info.plist)
- [x] Task 2: Create CalculatorModel Template (Stub with empty methods)
- [x] Task 3: Create CalculatorViewModel Template (Stub with basic properties)
- [x] Task 4: Create CalculatorButton Template (Stub with basic button structure)
- [x] Task 5: Implement CalculatorModel Logic (Add arithmetic operations and number handling)
- [x] Task 6: Implement CalculatorViewModel Logic (Add state management and user interaction)
- [x] Task 7: Implement CalculatorButton Component (Add styling and button types)
- [x] Task 8: Implement ContentView Layout (Add display area and button grid)
- [ ] Task 9: Integrate Components (Connect ViewModel to Views and handle user input)
- [ ] Task 10: Add Display Logic (Implement 8-digit limit and dynamic font sizing)
